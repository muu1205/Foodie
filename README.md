# Foodie
Project on Internet &amp; Web Programming

With the online food ordering method, food is ordered online and delivered to the customer.
This is made possible through the use of electronic payment system .The payment can be done
through the customer’s credit card, debit card. So, in this project we design a system which
will allow customers to go online and place order for their food. Due to the rapid growth in
the use of internet and the technologies associated with it, the several opportunities are 
coming up on the web. So many businesses and companies are now undertaking into their business
with comfort because of the internet. One of the businesses that the internet introduced is an
online food ordering system. In today’s life many restaurants have focus on quick preparation 
and speedy delivery of orders rather than offering a rich dining experience. Recently, most of
this delivery orders were placed over the phone, but there are many drawbacks of this system.
